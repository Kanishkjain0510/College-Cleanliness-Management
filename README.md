# JKLU Cleanliness Management System

## Overview
This is my first web development project, a web application designed to manage campus cleanliness at JKLU. This repository currently contains the frontend prototype, with plans to add the backend and basic frontend later.

## Repository Structure
- **`index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`**: Frontend for the login/signup page with user type selection (Student, Admin, Worker).
- **`dashboards/`**: Contains HTML and CSS files for admin, staff, and student dashboards, showcasing static data.
- **Future Addition**: A `backend-basic/` folder with a Node.js/Express backend and basic frontend will be added to support user authentication, issue reporting, task management, and inventory tracking.

## Features (Frontend Prototype)
- **Login/Signup Page**: User-friendly interface with user type selection, dynamic forms, and animations.
- **Dashboards**:
  - **Admin**: Displays staff, buildings, feedback, complaints, and leave applications (static data).
  - **Staff**: Shows tasks and staff metrics (static data).
  - **Student**: Includes a calendar, cleaning requests, complaints, and feedback sections (static data).
- Responsive design with sidebar navigation, cards, and a gradient-based UI.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (with custom styles and Font Awesome icons)
- JavaScript (for dynamic UI interactions)
