## Overview
This folder contains the HTML and CSS files for the dashboards of the JKLU Cleanliness Management System frontend prototype. These dashboards display static data for different user types.

- `staff-dashboard.html`, `staff.css`: Staff dashboard showing tasks and staff metrics.
- `student-dashboard.html`, `student.css`: Student dashboard with a calendar, cleaning requests, complaints, and feedback.

## Setup Instructions
1. Serve the parent directory (`JKLU-Cleanliness-Management/`) using a local server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000` or VS Code Live Server).
2. Access the dashboards via:
   - `dashboards/admin-dashboard.html`
   - `dashboards/staff-dashboard.html`

## Notes
